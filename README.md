# Logseq Cleanup Orphans Plugin

Automatically remove orphaned pages from Logseq with a keyboard shortcut and toolbar button.

## Features

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) to trigger cleanup
- **Toolbar Button**: Click the trash icon in the toolbar for quick access
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies orphaned pages (pages with no incoming references and no content)
- **Safe Deletion**: Shows confirmation dialog with count before deleting
- **Excludes Special Pages**: Automatically skips journal pages and system pages (logseq/*)

## What are Orphaned Pages?

Orphaned pages are pages that:
- Have no incoming references (no other pages or blocks link to them)
- Have no content (empty or single empty block)
- Are not journal pages
- Are not system pages (logseq/*)

## Installation

### Development Mode

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Logseq and go to Settings → Advanced → Developer mode
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Go to Settings → Plugins → Load unpacked plugin
5. Select the `logseq-cleanup-orphans` directory

### From Marketplace (Coming Soon)

Once published to the Logseq Marketplace, you can install it directly from Settings → Plugins → Marketplace.

## Usage

### Via Keyboard Shortcut

Press `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) to scan and remove orphaned pages.

### Via Toolbar

Click the trash icon in the Logseq toolbar to trigger the cleanup process.

### Via Command Palette

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette
2. Type "Cleanup: Remove orphaned pages"
3. Press Enter

## How It Works

1. The plugin scans all pages in your graph
2. For each page, it checks:
   - Does it have any incoming references?
   - Does it have any content?
3. Pages with no references and no content are marked as orphaned
4. You'll see a confirmation dialog showing how many orphaned pages were found
5. Upon confirmation, all orphaned pages are deleted
